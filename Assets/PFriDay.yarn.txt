PC: Nope, not yet.
P: I love her to death and would literally do anything in the world for her,
P: but oh my god, she drives me insane sometimes.
P: I had to convince her yesterday that we didn't need to serve you guys exactly 18 peas with dinner.
P: I was like, "VP, we can just scoop them out of the pot. Nobody cares."
P: But today I saw with a box of latex gloves and I know she plans on individually placing them on the plates.
P: Hahaha, sorry, I'm rambling.
P: Really, though. At the end of the day it's so nice to come home to a family of empowering girls
P: Who love you no matter what.
P: I remember when I was a freshman and your sister was a senior, I slept through my midterm
P: I was seriously freaking out
P: But your sister went to work late because it was more important to help little 18-year-old me
P: facing her first college meltdown.
P: It was devastating when I found out what happened.
P: I really looked up to her.
P: Ah, well I have a ton to do before tonight, but please let me know if you need anything at all.
P: Again, I'm so happy you're here, PC!
P: See you later.

PC: Yes! I've been so looking forward to it.
P: Ah, I'm so glad!
P: I was seriously so excited when I found out you were pledging us.
P: I know we don't know each other that well, but you give me a really down to earth vibe
P: And we definitely could use that around here sometimes.
P: Have you talked to VP yet?

PC: Well, I've actually been kinda anxious about all of this.
P: Oh my god, you do not have to feel anxious around us.
P: One of the best parts of being in Lambda Lambda is you have this whole support group of sisters
P: to help you through your anxiety.
P: We are all here for you.
