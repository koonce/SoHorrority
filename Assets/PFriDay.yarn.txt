<<Speaking Lucy>>
Nope, not yet.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
I love her to death and would literally do anything in the world for her,
but oh my god, she drives me insane sometimes.
I had to convince her yesterday that we didn't need to serve you guys exactly 18 peas with dinner.
I was like, "Lily, we can just scoop them out of the pot. Nobody cares."
But today I saw with a box of latex gloves and I know she plans on individually placing them on the plates.
Hahaha, sorry, I'm rambling.
Really, though. At the end of the day it's so nice to come home to a family of empowering girls
Who love you no matter what.
I remember when I was a freshman and your sister was a senior, I slept through my midterm
I was seriously freaking out
But your sister went to work late because it was more important to help little 18-year-old me
facing her first college meltdown.
It was devastating when I found out what happened.
I really looked up to her.
Ah, well I have a ton to do before tonight, but please let me know if you need anything at all.
Again, I'm so happy you're here, Lucy!
See you later.

<<Speaking Lucy>>
Yes! I've been so looking forward to it.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
<<Happy Krissy>>
Ah, I'm so glad!
I was seriously so excited when I found out you were pledging us.
<<Normal Krissy>>
I know we don't know each other that well, but you give me a really down to earth vibe
And we definitely could use that around here sometimes.
Have you talked to Lily yet?

<<Speaking Lucy>>
Well, I've actually been kinda anxious about all of this.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
Oh my god, you do not have to feel anxious around us.
One of the best parts of being in Lambda Lambda is you have this whole support group of sisters
to help you through your anxiety.
<<Happy Krissy>>
We are all here for you.
