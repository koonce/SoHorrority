Good... good.
You've shown enormous promise even in the short time you've been here.
We all think you'll be an amazing addition to the sorority, right?
<<Speaking Morgan>>
Mmhmm.
<<Speaking Lily>>
Of course!

<<Speaking Lucy>>
Thank you.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
Of course. 
However, there is still one thing you need to do.
<<Speaking Morgan>>
One more challenge you need to face.
<<Speaking Lily>>
One more trials you must prove yourself through.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
One final initiation ritual.

The Founder...?
<<Speaking Krissy>>
Yes.
<<Speaking Lucy>>
How is she still alive...?
It must've been hundreds of years.

<<Speaking Krissy>>
Here he is.
We come here every year, and give a little part of ourselves to him.
<<Speaking Morgan>>
We give a part of ourselves, so that we can be together.
<<Speaking Lily>>
So that we can be sisters... 
<<Speaking Krissy>>
So that you can be our sister.

My... sister.
<<Speaking Krissy>>
Yes. She is with us now. 
You can be with her. With us. 
Just give a piece of yourself up to him. 
I promise, you'll feel so much better when you don't need to feel things quite as much.
<<Speaking Morgan>>
When you can trust us, your sisters. 
<<Speaking Lily>>
It's how these things have always been. Us sisters have always stuck together.
