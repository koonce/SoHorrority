<<Speaking Krissy>>Hahaha, don't worry, we've got plenty.
<<Speaking Krissy>>We're gonna need something else, though.
<<Speaking Jaycee>>Oh, you should get lemonade! Lemonade is so good with vodka.
<<Speaking Krissy>>Lemonade is way too sugary, Jaycee, haha.
<<Speaking Krissy>>I don't want my teeth to get yellow.
<<Speaking Jaycee>>Oh yea, you're totally right, I guess I didn't think about that. You're right, lemonade is disgusting.
<<Speaking Krissy>>Well, I think I'll tell her to grab orange juice. There's a lot of low-sugar orange juice.
<<Speaking Krissy>>I'll be right back.
She turns around and leaves the conversation.

[[So, how's it going?|501w]]
