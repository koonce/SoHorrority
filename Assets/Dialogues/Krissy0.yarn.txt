Hey sisters! I’d like to give a big Lambda Lambda welcome to our newest pledges on our initiation weekend sleepover!
I am so excited to get to know all of you and hope you enjoy our luxurious Lambda Lambda house.
Okay, I know it’s not a castle, but it’s better than Kappa Gamma Chi across the street!
Last year, the brothers hired someone to deep clean the entire house and it still smells like sweat and beer.
<<Happy Krissy>>
Lucky for you, the sisters and I give off a slightly better odor. At least I hope, hahaha.
We really want you to have a fantastic weekend for us in the final round of recruitment...
...but before that we need to go over the Ten Lambda Lambda Commandments.
One. Thou must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA.
You’re all capable of it. Intelligence is a value here.
Two. Thou shall never wear high heels to a frat party.
Trust us.
Three. Thou must always change if a sister is wearing the same outfit.
I know this sounds nitpicky, but let’s be real. It’s not twin day at summer camp.
Four. Pay your dues on time.
You can make out your checks to Lambda Lambda Organization. Please bring them in on the first of the month.
Five. Thou shall refrain from puking in public.
Self-explanatory.
Six. Thou must know the Greek alphabet.
<<Sad Krissy>>
Yes, there will be a test.
<<Normal Krissy>>
Seven. Never will thy judge a sister.
Eight. Thou shall always have class.
Nine. Thou shall party with those Fraternity brothers.
Ten. Love thy sisters and thy sisters will love thou.
We are your friends, your family, and your support system. 
<<Sad Krissy>>
But we can only do that for you if you respect Lambda Lambda.
<<Happy Krissy>>
Okay, enough with the rules. This weekend is all about fun, so get to know one another!
Just a reminder not to enter the Chapter Room. It’s for the sisters, not the pledges.
And don’t forget, after you’re done socializing with your potential sisters, 
grab your pledge charm: a cat paw that should be sitting right upstairs!
Have fun!
