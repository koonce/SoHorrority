"Um, I'm going to have to call you back, Trav," she says as she hangs up the phone.
"Heyyyy! How's it going?? Are you excited or what?"

Right?? Like oh my god. This is always one of the best parties of the year. 
Last year we put Pitch Perfect on every TV in the house at 4AM...
...and every time the cup song played we'd pour a bottle of vodka in the pool!

[[Wow, that's crazy!|301]]

So what are you up to?
<<Speaking Lily>>
Oh, you know, just organizing, like, everything! 
I was just telling my boyfriend Travis what he needs to get for the party...
...and before that I was helping Emma with her outfit...
...and before that I was choosing whether to buy the red Doritos or the blue Doritos... 
It's been such a crazy day, haha.

[[Wow, you're amazing.|501]]
[[How do you manage all that??|502]]

Hahaha, thank you.
<<Speaking Lily>> <<Normal Lily>> <<Normal Lucy>>
Hahaha, yea. Sorry to change the topic, but I was wondering if you preferred Ocho or Patron, because I'm like, on the fence. 
And like Travis and President are so into Ocho, and I'm just not sure, you know?
<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
(You don't know what either of those things are. It sounds like alcohol.)

[[I like Ocho more.|701]]
[[Definitely Patron.|702]]

Okay! I'll let Travis know when I call him back, so he can get Patron. 
<<Sad Lucy>> <<Normal Lily>>
