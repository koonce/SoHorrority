<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
Oh... yea.
<<Speaking Morgan>> <<Normal Morgan>>
I hate to nitpick and everything, but that outfit isn't really right for this kind of party, haha. 
It's sort of a bit more... high class, you know?

[[Oh, okay.|301k]]
[[Oh shit, I'm sorry.|302k]]

Oh, okay.
<<Speaking Morgan>>
Yea, I mean, you don't have to change if you don't want to, but you know, you should look your best, you know?

You're a star, and you deserve to shine.

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
Oh shit, I'm sorry.
<<Speaking Morgan>> <<Sad Morgan>>
Oh no, don't apologize! Everyone I know is always apologizing for things.
<<Normal Morgan>> <<Normal Lucy>>
Instead of saying stuff like "I'm sorry I complain so much," say stuff like, "Thank you so much for listening to me."
<<Happy Morgan>>
It makes people feel better about themselves!

[[Wow, you're right!|added]]
