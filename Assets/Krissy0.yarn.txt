<<Speaking Krissy>>

Hey sisters! I’d like to give a big ΛΛ lambda lambda welcome to our newest pledges on our initiation weekend sleepover!
I am so excited to get to know all of you and hope you enjoy our luxurious lambda lambda house.
Okay, I know it’s not a castle, but it’s better than Kappa Gamma Chi across the street!
Last year the brothers hired someone to deep clean the entire house and it still smells like sweat and beer.
<<Happy Krissy>>
Lucky for you, the sisters and I give off a slightly better odor. At least I hope, hahaha.
We really want you to have a fantastic weekend for us in the final round of recruitment, but before that we need to go over the 10 Lambda Lambda Commandments.
1-Thou must maintain at least a 2.5 GPA
You’re all capable of it. Intelligence is a value.
2-Thou shall never wear high heels to a frat party.
Trust us.
3-Thou must always change if a sister owns the same outfit.
I know this is nitpicky, but let’s be real. It’s not twin day at summer camp.
4-Pay your dues on time.
You can make out your checks to Lambda Lambda Organization. Please bring them in on the first of the month.
5-Thou shall refrain from puking in public
Self-explanatory.
6-Thou must know the Greek alphabet.
<<Sad Krissy>>
Yes, there will be a test.
<<Normal Krissy>>
7-Never will thy judge a sister.
8-Thou shall always have class.
9-Thou shall party with those Fraternity brothers.
10-Love thy sisters and thy sisters will love thou.
We are your friends, your family, and your support system. 
<<Sad Krissy>>
But we can only do that for you if you respect Lambda Lambda.
<<Happy Krissy>>
Okay, enough with the rules. This weekend is about fun so get to know one another!
Just a reminder not to enter the Chapter Room. It’s for the sisters, not the pledges.
And don’t forget, after you’re done socializing with your potential sisters, 
grab your pledge charm: a cat paw that should be sitting right upstairs!
