<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Happy Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
Hey Jaycee, that was crazy yesterday!
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Sad Jaycee>>
Yeah, haha...
<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
Are you alright? 
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Happy Jaycee>>
Of course I am silly! It was just a bit of alcohol and... well.
<<Normal Jaycee>>
I don't know if you heard about Kayla.
[[Yeah, I did...|SundayJaycee1a]][[I didn't hear any details|SundayJaycee1b]]

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
Yeah, I did...
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Sad Jaycee>>
Crazy, what happened.
I hope she's okay now. 
<<Speaking Lucy>>
Lily talked to me about it. She didn't seem to want to give out any details.
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>>
Oh I can totally see why.
It was, like, a bit traumatizing. 
<<Speaking Lucy>>
I can't remember any of it. 
<<Speaking Jaycee>> 
Oh wow, really? You were that drunk?
[[Yeah, do you remember what happened?|SundayJaycee1c]][[Let's change the subject|SundayJaycee2b]]

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
I didn't hear any details.
<<Speaking Jaycee>>
Oh, it was pretty serious. 
<<Sad Jaycee>>
She passed out and starting spasming. It was really scary.
We called her mom and she said she had something called epilepts? 
<<Speaking Lucy>>
Epilepsy?
<<Speaking Jaycee>>
Yeah, that's the one. 
It was kind of scary.

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
Is she okay now?
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Sad Jaycee>>
I'm not sure, to be honest. 
They took off her in a gurney.
<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Normal Lucy>>
I hope she's alright. She was really nice. 
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
Yeah, although I'm not sure the upper classmen thought so.
But you didn't hear it from me.

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Happy Lucy>>
Let's change the subject! 
Are you excited for the initiation?
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Happy Jaycee>>
Oh yeah, totally. 
It's going to be wicked. 
And we're all finally going to be sisters!
<<Speaking Lucy>>
Yeah, I'm super excited too.
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
To be honest, maybe it was meant to be Kayla wouldn't be here for this.
I don't think she was going to get accepted, anyways. 
[[What do you mean by that?|SundayJaycee3a]]
[[Yeah, she was kind of weird|SundayJaycee3b]]

<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Sad Jaycee>>
Um... nothing. 
<<Speaking Lucy>>
Come on, Jaycee. Spit it out.
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
It's nothing, I swear. 
I just heard them discussing her and the other pledges. Us. 
They liked us more than her, is all.
[[Wow, really? That's flattering|SundayJaycee4a]][[That's kinda fucked up|SundayJaycee4b]]

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
Yeah, she was kinda weird, wasn't she?
<<Speaking Jaycee>>
Uh huh, totally weird. 
And... idk.
She didn't seem to fit in with the rest of us.
<<Speaking Lucy>> 
I mean I hate saying that out loud, but you're right. 
She wouldn't have been happy here, I think. 
<<Speaking Jaycee>>
Yeah, I think the upperclassmen thought so too...

It is kind of flattering, I'll admit. 
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Happy Jaycee>>
I know right!
I'm so glad they like us. I was kinda worried I embarassed myself last night.
<<Speaking Lucy>>
Me too, haha. 
<<Sad Lucy>>
Especially since I can't remember what happened,
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>>
Was it your first time drinking like that? 
[[Yeah|SundayJaycee5a]][[Nah, I've had experience|SundayJaycee5b]]

That's kinda fucked up.
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Sad Jaycee>>
A bit, yeah.
<<Speaking Lucy>>
I mean, I know the whole point of this was for them to judge us. 
But considering the circumstances it just feels weird.
<<Speaking Jaycee>> 
Yeah, I know what you mean. 
<<Normal Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>>
It does feel kind of good knowing we're IN, so to speak.
Doesn't it?

<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Normal Lucy>> <<Normal Jaycee>>
Hate to say it, but it makes sense.
<<Speaking Jaycee>>
Yeah, she didn't really get "in" on any of our activities. 
It totally looked like she wasn't interested.
<<Speaking Lucy>> <<Sad Lucy>>
Yeah...
<<Speaking Jaycee>> <<Normal Lucy>>
I'm so glad that we're in though.
